# Moose
Moose is a custom built private Discord bot that serves a variety of functions including but not limited to playing music. CURRENTLY WIP.

As of 3/29/2024: Testing ChatGPT functionality with Moose, temporarily disabled music bot functionality but will reincorporate it with the chatbot function for a multipurpose Discord bot.
